## Agent Prompt: SGLang-Mamba Phased Testing Plan

You are a testing agent with full shell, filesystem, and Python access to a running SGLang-Mamba installation on an isolated VM. Your task is to **plan and implement a comprehensive, phased testing scenario** for this codebase. Read this entire prompt before beginning any work.

The codebase is rooted at the SGLang source tree. You will be running tests against a Mamba-family (SSM/hybrid) model. The test infrastructure is located primarily under `test/` and `phase3/`. Existing registered CI tests live in `test/registered/`. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) chat interface is already available for qualitative smoke checks.

### Orientation: What Was Added

This fork extends upstream SGLang with a **stateful Mamba inference architecture**. The stateful components are:

1. **`HybridReqToTokenPool` + `MambaPool`** (`python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/memory_pool.py`) — GPU tensor storage for per-request Mamba conv/temporal states, with a `req_index_to_mamba_index_mapping` for O(1) lookup. [1] 

2. **`HybridLinearKVPool`** (`python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/memory_pool.py`) — A hybrid KV pool that stores attention-layer KV cache and exposes Mamba pool references to the radix cache. [2] 

3. **`MambaRadixCache`** (`python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/mamba_radix_cache.py`) — A hybrid radix tree with **dual LRU lists** (`full_lru_list` and `mamba_lru_list`), dual lock refs (`full_lock_ref`, `mamba_lock_ref`), tombstone nodes (KV present but Mamba state evicted), and copy-on-write (`cow_mamba`). [3] [4] 

4. **`ForwardMetadata` / `Mamba2Metadata`** (`python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/mamba/mamba2_metadata.py`) — Per-forward-pass metadata carrying `mamba_cache_indices`, `track_conv_indices`, `track_ssm_h_src/dst`, `track_ssm_final_src/dst`, and chunked-prefill chunk index/offset tensors. [5] 

5. **`MambaMixer2` + `hybrid_linear_attn_backend`** (`python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/hybrid_linear_attn_backend.py`) — The Mamba2 SSM kernel integration, including `causal_conv1d_fn`, `causal_conv1d_update`, and the GDN/Lightning hybrid variants. [6] 

6. **`mamba_branching_seqlen` / COW** — Computed during `MambaRadixCache._match_post_processor()` when a KV hit extends past the last valid Mamba state (tombstone gap); consumed during prefill to re-anchor the SSM state at the correct chunk-aligned divergence point. [7] 

7. **`mamba_scheduler_strategy`** (`python/sglang/srt/server_args.py`) — Two runtime modes: `no_buffer` (default, no overlap) and `extra_buffer` (ping-pong track buffer, supports chunked prefill and speculative decoding).

8. **Snapshot system** (`python/sglang/srt/snapshot/`) — `POST /save_snapshot` and `POST /restore_snapshot` HTTP endpoints; `MambaSnapshotManager` for safetensors-based disk persistence of conv and temporal states; `TierManager`, `ConversationTracker`, `SnapshotPolicy`, `MambaHostPool`. [8] 

---

### Existing Test Infrastructure

Familiarize yourself with these before writing anything new:

- **Registered unit tests**: `test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_unittest.py` — covers `test_hybrid_linear_kv_pool`, `test_mamba_pool`, `test_mamba_radix_cache_1`. [9] 

- **Comprehensive radix cache tests**: `test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py` — 10 tests covering tombstones, LRU integrity, lock ref protection, full-cache eviction, COW, leaf-only eviction, empty cache, evictable size tracking, and `mamba_branching_seqlen`. [10] 

- **Phase 3 test plan** (`phase3/test/test_plan.md`) — Documents all planned but not-yet-written integration and E2E tests. Read this to understand what is **✅ done** vs **⬜ planned**. [11] 

- **Coverage report** (`phase3/tests/test_coverage_report.md`) — Current coverage targets for `MambaRadixCache` components. [12] 

- **Test runner**: `python test/run_suite.py --hw cuda --suite stage-b-test-small-1-gpu` [13] 

- **CI registration pattern**: Use `register_cuda_ci(est_time=..., suite="stage-b-test-small-1-gpu")` from `sglang.test.ci.ci_register` for any new test files. [14] 

---

### Your Mission: Implement the Following Phases

---

#### PHASE 0 — Environment Verification (Pre-flight)

Before any test, verify the install is healthy:

1. Confirm `pip install -e python/` is complete and `import sglang` succeeds.
2. Run `python -m pytest test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_unittest.py -v` and confirm all 3 existing tests pass (these are CPU/lightweight and require no server).
3. Run `python -m pytest test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py -v` and confirm all collected tests pass.
4. Report any failures with full tracebacks before proceeding.

---

#### PHASE 1 — Stateless Inference Baseline (No Mamba-Specific Architecture Active)

**Goal**: Verify the server boots and serves correct outputs **without touching `MambaRadixCache`, `MambaPool`, or any snapshot machinery**. This gives you a known-good inference baseline to diff against later phases.

**Server launch**: Start the server with `--disable-radix-cache` to bypass `MambaRadixCache` entirely, using the `no_buffer` scheduler strategy (the default). Confirm `mambaish_config` is set (you should see `HybridReqToTokenPool` log lines) but the radix cache code path is skipped. The server exposes `POST /v1/chat/completions` via `python/sglang/srt/entrypoints/http_server.py`.

**Test suite to implement** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_baseline_inference.py`):

- `test_health_endpoint` — `GET /health` returns 200.
- `test_single_turn_completion` — Single `/v1/chat/completions` request returns a non-empty response with correct finish reason.
- `test_streaming_completion` — Same with `stream=True`; verify all SSE chunks arrive and the final chunk has `finish_reason`.
- `test_batch_inference_independence` — Send N=4 requests with **identical** prompts concurrently; verify all responses are identical (deterministic, `temperature=0`). This is your baseline for state isolation.
- `test_batch_inference_different_prompts` — Send 4 different prompts; verify each response is semantically distinct.
- `test_long_context` — Send a prompt with a long system prompt (>512 tokens) and verify the model responds without OOM or truncation error.
- `test_sampling_params` — Vary `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_new_tokens`; verify response length and stop conditions are respected.

**HITL check**: After the automated tests pass, use the chat interface to have a short 3-turn conversation manually and confirm coherent responses. Log the exchange.

**Pass criteria**: All automated tests green; HITL chat coherent; no CUDA errors in server logs.

---

#### PHASE 2 — `MambaPool` + `HybridReqToTokenPool` Unit Tests

**Goal**: Verify the memory pool layer in isolation, with no server running.

**What to do**:

1. Re-run the existing `test_mamba_pool` and `test_hybrid_linear_kv_pool` from `test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_unittest.py` with verbose output and confirm they pass. [15] 

2. **Write additional tests** in a new file `test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_pool_extended.py`:
   - `test_pool_exhaustion` — Allocate `mamba_cache_size` slots; assert next alloc fails gracefully (returns `None` or raises expected error).
   - `test_mamba_pool_reuse_on_no_free` — Allocate a req, call `free(req)` without calling `free_mamba_cache(req)`, re-alloc same req object — verify `mamba_pool.available_size()` does **not** decrease further (the leaked slot is reused). This is the exact scenario tested in `test_mamba_pool` lines 130–140. [16] 
   - `test_mamba_state_dtype_override` — Use `envs.SGLANG_MAMBA_SSM_DTYPE.override("bfloat16")` context and verify `Mamba2CacheParams` uses bfloat16 for temporal states, as shown in the existing test setup. [17] 
   - `test_get_mamba_indices_mapping` — Call `req_to_token_pool.get_mamba_indices(req_pool_indices_tensor)` after alloc and verify the returned indices match `req.mamba_pool_idx`.
   - `test_enable_mamba_extra_buffer_false` — Explicitly construct `HybridReqToTokenPool` with `enable_mamba_extra_buffer=False`; confirm no `mamba_ping_pong_track_buffer` is allocated.

**Pass criteria**: All tests green; no torch memory leaks between tests (check `mamba_pool.available_size()` returns to initial value in teardown).

---

#### PHASE 3 — `MambaRadixCache` Component Tests

**Goal**: Exercise all `MambaRadixCache` operations: insert, match, evict (full and Mamba), tombstone lifecycle, LRU integrity, and COW.

**What to do**:

1. Re-run both existing test files:
   - `python -m pytest test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_unittest.py::TestMamba::test_mamba_radix_cache_1 -v`
   - `python -m pytest test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py -v`

2. **Gauntlet tests to write** in `test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_radix_cache_gauntlet.py`:

   - `test_interleaved_insert_evict_match` — Insert 10 sequences; interleave `evict_mamba(1)` and `evict_full(1)` calls between each insert; verify `sanity_check()` passes after every operation. The `sanity_check()` method validates LRU list integrity end-to-end. [18] 

   - `test_tombstone_does_not_match_mamba` — Insert `[1,2,3]` with mamba state; evict its mamba state via `evict_mamba(1)` (creating a tombstone); then `match_prefix([1,2,3])` and assert `last_node.mamba_value is None` but KV indices are still returned. [19] 

   - `test_branching_seqlen_triggered` — Build a scenario where the KV cache hit extends past the last Mamba node (tombstone gap exists); call `match_prefix` and verify `result.mamba_branching_seqlen` is not None and is chunk-aligned. [20] 

   - `test_cow_state_independence` — After COW, modify the original cached node's `mamba_value`; verify the copied state on the request is unaffected. This proves true copy semantics. [21] 

   - `test_inc_dec_lock_ref_symmetry` — For a 3-node chain (root → A → B), call `inc_lock_ref(B)` and verify `full_lock_ref` propagates up to A and root, and `mamba_lock_ref` locks only B. Then `dec_lock_ref(B)` and verify all counters return to 0. [22] 

   - `test_full_evictable_and_protected_size_accounting` — After every `inc_lock_ref`, `dec_lock_ref`, insert, and evict, verify that `full_evictable_size() + full_protected_size()` equals the total tokens cached (i.e., sizes are always conserved). [23] 

**Pass criteria**: All tests green; `sanity_check()` passes after every test case (call it in `tearDown`).

---

#### PHASE 4 — Live Server Integration: `MambaRadixCache` + `no_buffer` Strategy

**Goal**: Verify the radix cache is populated and queried correctly during actual server inference, using `mamba_scheduler_strategy=no_buffer` (the default).

**Server launch**: Start server **with** radix cache enabled (do not pass `--disable-radix-cache`), `--mamba-scheduler-strategy no_buffer`.

**Tests to implement** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_radix_cache_server_integration.py`):

- `test_cache_hit_on_repeated_prefix` — Send request A with a long system prompt + question 1. Then send request B with the **same** system prompt + question 2. Query `GET /get_memory_pool_size` or inspect server logs; verify the second request has a shorter prefill (cache hit). At `temperature=0`, the answer to question 2 must be deterministic and correct.
- `test_cache_miss_fallback` — Send a request with a prefix that has never been seen; verify correct generation (cache miss does not corrupt output).
- `test_concurrent_shared_prefix` — Send 4 concurrent requests that all share the same long system prompt. Assert that all 4 complete successfully, outputs are independent, and no state contamination occurs (the state isolation invariant: `mamba_lock_ref` semantics).
- `test_multi_turn_conversation_state_continuity` — Simulate a 5-turn conversation using `session_id` / `rid` continuity via the native API. After each turn, the next turn should generate contextually coherent continuations. Log all 5 turns.
- `test_eviction_under_pressure` — Fill the Mamba cache to near-capacity by sending many short distinct requests; verify that new requests still succeed (eviction triggers correctly and the server does not OOM or error).

**Pass criteria**: All automated tests green; HITL: Use the chat interface to do a 5-turn conversation and confirm persistent context.

---

#### PHASE 5 — `Mamba2Metadata` / `ForwardMetadata` Integrity

**Goal**: Verify that the metadata constructed during each forward pass is correct for prefill, decode, and mixed batches.

**Approach**: Write targeted unit tests against `Mamba2Metadata.prepare_decode()` and `Mamba2Metadata.prepare_mixed()` using synthetic `ForwardBatch` objects (no server needed). [24] 

**Tests to implement** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_metadata.py`):

- `test_prepare_decode_pure_decode_batch` — Verify `num_prefills=0`, `num_decodes=N`, `mixed_metadata=None`.
- `test_prepare_mixed_prefill_only` — Verify `num_prefills=N`, `num_decodes=0`, `mixed_metadata` is populated.
- `test_chunk_indices_offsets_correctness` — Use the static method `Mamba2Metadata._query_start_loc_to_chunk_indices_offsets` with the worked example from the docstring (`query_start_loc=[0,5,10]`, `chunk_size=8`) and assert `chunk_indices=[0,0,1]`, `chunk_offsets=[0,5,0]`. [25] 
- `test_has_initial_states_flag` — Provide `context_lens_tensor` with mixed zeros and non-zeros; verify `has_initial_states` tensor is correct and `prep_initial_states` is True only when any non-zero is present.
- `test_mamba_cache_indices_preserved` — Verify `mamba_cache_indices` from the base `ForwardMetadata` is passed through unchanged to the produced `Mamba2Metadata`.

---

#### PHASE 6 — `mamba_scheduler_strategy=extra_buffer`

**Goal**: Verify the ping-pong buffer path works end-to-end. This mode enables overlap scheduling and is required for speculative decoding.

**Server launch**: `--mamba-scheduler-strategy extra_buffer`

**Tests to implement** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_extra_buffer.py`):

- `test_extra_buffer_alloc` — Verify that after `HybridReqToTokenPool.alloc([req])` with `enable_mamba_extra_buffer=True`, `req.mamba_ping_pong_track_buffer` is non-None and has the expected size (2 for non-speculative).
- `test_extra_buffer_free_with_keep` — Verify `free_mamba_cache(req, mamba_ping_pong_track_buffer_to_keep=idx)` frees the main slot and all but one ping-pong slot, and the kept slot's tensor data is intact.
- `test_cache_unfinished_req_extra_buffer` — Simulate the `cache_unfinished_req` code path by calling it on a mock req with `mamba_last_track_seqlen` set; verify `mamba_branching_seqlen` is cleared and `prefix_indices` is updated. [26] 
- `test_server_inference_extra_buffer_mode` — Do a basic inference request through the running server in `extra_buffer` mode; verify output correctness matches Phase 1 baseline for the same prompt at `temperature=0`.

---

#### PHASE 7 — Snapshot System

**Goal**: Verify `POST /save_snapshot` and `POST /restore_snapshot` end-to-end.

**Server launch**: `--enable-mamba-snapshots` (or `--enable-snapshot-persistence`) in addition to normal args.

**Tests to implement** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_snapshot_e2e.py`):

- `test_save_snapshot_returns_success` — After generating some tokens for a request (obtain a `rid`), call `POST /save_snapshot` with that `rid`; assert `success=True` in response.
- `test_restore_snapshot_state_equivalence` — Save a snapshot after turn N. Generate turn N+1 from the live state. Then restore the snapshot and re-generate turn N+1 from the restored state (at `temperature=0`). Assert the two outputs are identical — this proves state fidelity.
- `test_restore_requires_idle_request` — Attempt to restore a snapshot while the request is in `running_batch`; verify `success=False` is returned gracefully.
- `test_snapshot_disk_format` — After save, locate the `.safetensors` and `.json` metadata files on disk and verify they contain `conv_states` and `temporal_states` keys matching the expected layer count.
- `test_snapshot_manager_tier_consistency` — Verify `TierManager` promotes/demotes snapshots between GPU, host (`MambaHostPool`), and disk tiers without data corruption. Write a small mock that exercises the tier transitions directly. [27] [28] 

**HITL check**: Use the chat interface to generate a 3-turn conversation, save a snapshot after turn 2, then continue to turn 3. Restore the snapshot and ask a variation of turn 3's question; confirm the answer reflects only turns 1–2 context, not turn 3.

---

#### PHASE 8 — Gauntlet / Stress Tests

**Goal**: Break things under load to find race conditions, memory leaks, and eviction policy failures.

**Tests to run** (`test/registered/radix_cache/test_mamba_stress.py`):

1. **Sustained high-concurrency request flood** — Send 10k RPS targeting `/v1/chat/completions` for 5 minutes minimum. Monitor throughput stability and error rate.
   - **Pass criteria**: p95 latency ≤ 2x baseline, p99 ≤ 3x baseline, error rate < 0.1%, no crashes.
   - **Duration**: 5 minutes minimum
   - **Tooling**: Locust, wrk, or custom async client with `asyncio`
   - **Observability**: Prometheus metrics or server logs for latency histograms, request counts, error counts

2. **Memory leak detection via prolonged soak tests** — Run server under moderate load (100 RPS) for 24–72 hours while monitoring RSS/heap growth.
   - **Pass criteria**: RSS growth < 10% over 24h, no unbounded memory growth detected by `tracemalloc` or `memory_profiler`
   - **Duration**: 24–72 hours
   - **Tooling**: `psutil` for RSS monitoring, `tracemalloc` for Python heap, optional `valgrind` for C++ extensions
   - **Observability**: RSS samples every 5 minutes, heap snapshots every hour

3. **Eviction policy validation under full cache pressure** — Fill Mamba cache to 100% capacity, then send requests that trigger eviction. Verify correct LRU eviction order.
   - **Pass criteria**: 100% of evictions follow LRU policy (least recently accessed node evicted first), verified by cache access timestamps
   - **Duration**: 10 minutes
   - **Tooling**: Custom test script that queries cache state via internal APIs or logs
   - **Observability**: Cache hit/miss rates, eviction logs with node IDs and timestamps

4. **Race-condition/consistency fuzzing with concurrent reads/writes and conflict injection** — Run 100+ threads performing concurrent cache operations (insert, match, evict) with intentionally overlapping keys.
   - **Pass criteria**: No data corruption detected, no crashes, all operations return consistent results, `sanity_check()` passes after every operation batch
   - **Duration**: 30 minutes
   - **Tooling**: `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution, custom fuzzer with randomized operation sequences
   - **Observability**: Operation logs with thread IDs, error counts, `sanity_check()` pass/fail

5. **Chaos injection (network partitions, latency spikes, node restarts)** — Use chaos engineering tools to inject failures while server is under load.
   - **Pass criteria**: Server recovers gracefully from all injected failures, no data loss, < 1% unrecoverable errors
   - **Duration**: 2 hours
   - **Tooling**: `toxiproxy` for network faults, `kill -9` for abrupt shutdowns, `tc` (traffic control) for latency injection
   - **Observability**: Failure injection timeline, recovery times, error logs

6. **Persistence & recovery under abrupt shutdowns** — Save snapshots, kill server with `kill -9`, restart, and verify all snapshots are recoverable.
   - **Pass criteria**: 100% of snapshots recoverable after abrupt shutdown, restored state matches pre-shutdown state (verified by deterministic output at `temperature=0`)
   - **Duration**: 1 hour (multiple shutdown/restart cycles)
   - **Tooling**: Custom script with `subprocess.Popen`, `kill -9`, snapshot integrity checks
   - **Observability**: Snapshot file checksums, restore success rate, output equivalence checks

**HITL check**: After automated stress tests pass, manually review server logs for any unexpected warnings or errors. Verify that the server remains responsive and that HITL chat interface still functions correctly.

**Pass criteria summary**: All 6 test categories pass their individual criteria, no server crashes beyond acceptable error rate (< 0.1% for transient failures, 0% for crashes), and HITL verification confirms server health.

**Notes on automation**:
- All tests should be runnable via `pytest` or standalone Python scripts
- Results should be machine-readable (JSON or structured logs) for CI integration
- For 24–72h soak tests, use a separate long-running test suite (not per-commit CI)
- Recommended observability stack: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, structured logging with timestamps

    @staticmethod
    def _query_start_loc_to_chunk_indices_offsets(
        query_start_loc: torch.Tensor, chunk_size: int, total_seqlens: int
    ) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
        """
        Args:
            query_start_loc (torch.Tensor): 1D tensor of cumulative sequence
                lengths, shape (num_seqs + 1,).
                The first element should be 0. Each entry represents the starting
                index of a sequence in the flattened token array.
            chunk_size (int): The size of each physical mamba chunk
                (number of tokens per chunk).
            total_seqlens (int): The total number of tokens in the batch.

        Returns:
            Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: A tuple containing:
                - chunk_indices (torch.Tensor): 1D tensor of indices
                    indicating the physical chunk for each logical chunk.
                - chunk_offsets (torch.Tensor): 1D tensor of offsets
                    indicating the starting index of each logical chunk within
                    its physical chunk.

        This function computes the chunk indices and offsets for the given
        query_start_loc and chunk_size. Both are tensors of integers with length N,
        where N is the number of logical (pseudo) chunks.
        A logical chunk is a sequence of tokens that are all part of the same
        sequence and are all in the same physical mamba chunk.
        In other words, a logical chunk changes every time we cross a sequence
        boundary or a physical mamba chunk boundary.
        Logical chunks are needed to handle batched requests with initial states
        (see _state_passing_fwd and _chunk_scan_fwd).
        The chunk_indices tensor contains the index of the physical chunk for each
        logical chunk.
        The chunk_offsets tensor contains the offset (AKA starting index) of the
        logical chunk in the physical chunk.

        Example:
        query_start_loc = [0, 5, 10]
        chunk_size = 8
        total_seqlens = 10
        -> chunk_indices = [0, 0, 1]
        -> chunk_offsets = [0, 5, 0]

        In this example, we have 2 sequences, each with 5 tokens. The physical
        chunk size is 8 tokens.
        We have three logical chunks:
        - the first logical chunk starts at token 0 in the first physical chunk
            and contains all 5 tokens from the first sequence
        - the second logical chunk starts at token 5 in the first physical chunk
            and contains first 3 tokens from the second sequence
        - the third logical chunk starts at token 0 in the second physical chunk
            and contains the remaining 2 tokens from the second sequence

        # outputs will have length expansion of chunks that do not divide

Comprehensive unit tests for MambaRadixCache implementation.

This module provides extensive test coverage for MambaRadixCache, focusing on:
- Tombstone node behavior (nodes with KV cache but no Mamba state)
- LRU list management (dual lists for full and Mamba eviction)
- Lock reference counting (full_lock_ref and mamba_lock_ref)
- Edge cases (empty cache, full cache, eviction pressure)
- Page-aligned operations
- Copy-on-write (COW) functionality
- Eviction policy correctness

Test Coverage (NEW):
✅ Tombstone nodes: Creation, eviction, and lifecycle
✅ LRU lists: Dual list integrity, MRU/LRU ordering
✅ Lock refs: Protection from eviction, reference counting
✅ Edge cases: Boundary conditions, full cache scenarios
✅ COW: State copying, independent modifications
✅ Eviction: LRU policy, leaf-only eviction for full cache

Usage:
    python test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py
    python -m pytest test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py -v
    python -m pytest test_mamba_radix_cache_comprehensive.py::TestMambaRadixCacheComprehensive::test_tombstone_node_creation

## 🧪 New Test Cases Added

### 1. `test_tombstone_node_creation`
**Purpose:** Validate tombstone node behavior (nodes with KV cache but no Mamba state)

**Test Scenario:**
- Insert sequence [1, 2, 3]
- Insert longer sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Evict Mamba state from [1, 2, 3] → creates tombstone
- Verify match returns empty for tombstone node
- Verify match succeeds for non-tombstone node

**Coverage:**
- Tombstone creation via eviction
- Match behavior with tombstones
- KV cache retention after Mamba eviction

---

### 2. `test_lru_list_integrity`
**Purpose:** Verify LRU lists maintain correct ordering

**Test Scenario:**
- Insert 3 sequences: [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
